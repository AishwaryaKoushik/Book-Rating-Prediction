# Book-Rating-Prediction

A model is implemented to predict the book rating based on the dataset containing the reviews that the book has received and other relevant information. The main goal is to try different models and parameters to train the dataset. The classification problem is addressed and weighted F1 score is the metric which indicates the performance of the model. The heart of the model lies within Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its main techniques. The project flow starts with preprocessing the dataset to include the important features and analyzing these features in order to enhance the model’s performance and accuracy. NLP techniques are exploited throughout the project to comprehend the book rating based on the reviews.

For ease and simplicity, the project is broken down into 4 sections -
  ● Pre-Processing
  ● Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Representation
  ● Standardization
  ● Classification


Two models have been used to perform classification - 
  1. Random Forest Classifier
  2. Logistic Regression
